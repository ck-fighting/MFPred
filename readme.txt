Ten-Flod_Data: store the data set, ten-fold cross-validation contains ten test sets and ten training sets
Data_create: data processing, put the base information of each RNA sequence into Train_Matrix, put the classification information of each RNA sequence into Train_Label
Main_program: Main program is used for model training and data processing and displaying training results and saving the best training model
Model: Model BiGRU ResNet+SE
Preformance: The best model will be saved for the prediction of the final results due to the result prediction of the test set.
